it's very easy to use this tool, you only need one line of code to add this tool to your project: `logging.AddTinyTxt();`ã€‚

## installition

you can include this tool from NuGet with name Lvhang.TinyTxtLogger.

```
IHost host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureLogging((context, logging) =>

    {

        logging.ClearProviders();

        logging.AddTinyTxt();//add TinyTxtLogger

    })

    .ConfigureServices(services =>

    {

        services.AddHostedService<Worker>();

    })

    .Build();
```

## configuration
there's two way to configure the tool

**way 1 with code:**

```
logging.AddTinyTxt(options =>

        {

            options.TxtLogFolderName = "logs"; //log folder name

            options.LogFileNamePrefix = "log"; //log file prefix

            options.RollingInterval = eRollingInterval.Day; //log file rolling interval

            options.FileSizeLimit = 10240;// size limit of single file

           options.AutoCleanLogFolder = false; // if log file in folder over the limit if clean the folder

            options.ReserveLogFileCount = 30; //log file reserve when clean the log folder

        });
```   

**way 2 with appsetting.json file:**

  ```
{

  "Logging": {

    "LogLevel": {

      "Default": "Trace",

      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Trace"

    },

    "TinyTxt": {

      "LogLevel": {

        "Default": "Trace",

        "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Trace"

      },

      "Options": {

        "TxtLogFolderName": "logs",

        "LogFileNamePrefix": "log",

        "RollingInterval": "Year",  // Hour,Day,Month,Year,Infinite

        "FileSizeLimit": 10240,  //in KB

        "AutoCleanLogFolder": false,

        "ReserveLogFileCount": 30

      }

    }

  }

}
``` 

after you complete your configuration in appsetting.json, you need add one line to your code to bind your configuration:

``` 
IHost host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)

    .BindTinyTxtLoggerOptions() //this line to bind configuration

    .ConfigureLogging((context, logging) =>

    {

        logging.ClearProviders();

        logging.AddTinyTxt(;

    })

    .ConfigureServices(services =>

    {
        services.AddHostedService<Worker>();

    })

    .Build();
``` 

and that's almost every this of this tool, except that this project provide a tool to help you to view log file more friendly.
